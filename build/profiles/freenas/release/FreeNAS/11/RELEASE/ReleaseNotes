OS:
The base OS version for FreeNAS 9.10 is now FreeBSD 10.3-RC3,
bringing in a huge number of OS-related bug fixes, performance
improvements and new features (new drivers, new CPU chipset support,
USB 3.0, etc) and basic support for hosting virtual machines with
bhyve.

Directory Services:
You can now connect to large AD domains with cache disabled.

Reporting:
Add the ability to send collectd data to a remote graphite server.

Hardware Support:
Added Support for Intel I219-V & I219-LM Gigabit Ethernet Chipset
Added Support for Intel Skylake architecture
Improved support for USB devices (like network adapters)
USB 3.0 devices now supported.

Filesharing:
Samba (SMB filesharing) updated from version 4.1 to 4.3.4
Added GUI feature to allow nfsv3-like ownership when using nfsv4
Various bug fixes related to FreeBSD 10. For more in-depth information,
see the ChangeLog file.

Ports:
FreeBSD ports updated to follow the FreeBSD 2016Q2 branch.

Jails:
FreeBSD Jails now default to a FreeBSD 10.3-RC2 based template.
Old jails, or systems on which jails have been installed, will still
default to the previous FreeBSD 9.3 based template.  Only those machines
using jails for the first time (or deleting and recreating their jails
dataset) will use the new template.

bhyve:
In the upcoming 10 release, the CLI will offer full support for managing
virtual machines and containers. Until then, the iohyve command is
bundled as a stop-gap solution to provide basic VM management support -
see https://github.com/pr1ntf/iohyve for more information.

Trains:
Nightlies branch now gets you FreeNAS-9.10-Nightlies
This release, and all future updates to it, are on the FreeNAS-9.10-STABLE
train.
