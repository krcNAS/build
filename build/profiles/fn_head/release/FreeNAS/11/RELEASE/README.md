# Building / Updating FreeNAS 9.10

To build FreeNAS 9.10 from scratch (experts only):

## Requirements:

* Your build environment must be FreeBSD 10.x (or 10-STABLE)
(building on FreeBSD 9 or 11 is not supported at this time).

* An amd64 capable processor.  12GB of memory, or an equal/greater amount
  of swap space, is also required.

* You will need the following ports/packages when compiling anything
  FreeNAS-related:
  * ports-mgmt/poudriere-devel
  * devel/git
  * sysutils/cdrtools
  * archivers/pxz
  * lang/python3 (3.4 or later, must also be installed)
  * sysutils/grub2-pcbsd
  * sysutils/xorriso
  * devel/gmake

  (and all the dependencies that these ports/pkgs install, of course)
  
  You can also use ```make bootstrap-pkgs``` to let it install required
  dependencies automatically. It will only install whats listed in the Makefile
  you will need to install textproc/py-sphinx_numfig 
  from the ports systems as there are no packages available.

## Building the System Quickstart Flow:

Note: All these commands must be run as `root`.

```
% make checkout
% make release
```

* Update the source tree to pull in new source code changes

```
% make update
```

This will also fetch TrueOS and ports for the build from github.

## The End Result:

If your build completes successfully, you'll have release bits in the _BE
directory.
